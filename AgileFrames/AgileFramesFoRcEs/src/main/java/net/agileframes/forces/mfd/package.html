The <i>Machine Function Driver</i> Interfaces.
<p><b>Tasks</b>
<br>The Machine Function Driver has four fundamental tasks:
<ul>
<li>
StateFinder - Estimation of the state of execution</li>

<li>
ManoeuvreDriver - Deduction of the next execution-step</li>

<li>
Instructor - Deduction of the machine-type dependent internal directives</li>

<li>
PhysicalDriver - Deduction of the specific circumstantial dependent internal
directives</li>
</ul>
<b>The machine function driver (mfd) as information object</b>
<br>During the execution of a scene-action, the manoeuvres and the related
trajectories are temporary objects: when finished, manoeuvre is discarded
and, next, the succeeding manoeuvre will be created and activated. The
permanent base is the executing machine, or, more abstractly, the information
object: machine function driver (mfd). An mfd represents the ‘machine’,
operates as permanent executor. In the mfd five executing modules are distinguished:
ManoeuvreDriver; Communicator; StateFinder; Instructor and PhysicalDriver.
<br>When a machine is started, an actor is made available simultaneously.
An actor is equipped with an ‘intelligent communicator’ which it uses to
communicate remotely with other actors. Normally, the actor normally is
located on the same computer platform as the mfd, but if not, he can use
its communicator to communicate remotely with its machine.
<br>The ManoeuvreDriver triggers cyclic-updating. The stateFinder identifies
the state of execution. The instructor translates the pilot course and
reference acceleration in machine-type dependent instructions. In this
also ‘local information’ (localInformation) can be taken into account;
for example, the distance of an in front driving vehicle. Taking into account
the behaviour of a specific machine in specific circumstances, PhysicalDriver
deduces the directives for the mechanic-electronic interface.
<p><b>The manoeuvre driver</b>
<br>The class ManoeuvreDriver is completely programmed, but its ‘program’
is invisible for the user. Via the methods anticipate and begin, a manoeuvre
driver receives its instructions from the executing actor of an action-script,
where the manoeuvre in question is attached as actual parameter.
<p><b>The state finder</b>
<br>Regarding the function-state, StateFinder is almost generic and ‘ready-to-use’.
That is to say the data-structures and method getObservedEvolution are
fully implemented. However, the original observations on the current function-states,
which might be obtained by special instruments and special observation
models and, therefore, must be specially programmed. For ‘local information’
and ‘response information’, this applies even up to the internal data-structures
within the machine function driver. Therefore the classes LocalInformation
and ResponseInformation must be user-programmed. StateFinder works cyclically.
Invocation of the update-method activates an updating-cycle. Then, on bases
of the most recent observations (but invisible for the user), new observations
are calculated.
<p><b>The instructor and the physical driver</b>
<br>The classes Instructor and PhysicalDriver are primarily machine-type
dependent and, consequently, each machine-type requires its own variant.
Both Instructor and PhysicalDriver operate cyclically, to be triggered
by the update-method.
<br>The task of instructor is to translate the pilot-course (from ManoeuvreDriver)
and the reference acceleration in machine-type dependent ‘machine instructions’.
Next, physicalDriver translates these in instructions to the mechatronic
interface. During these translation steps the indicated course and acceleration
might be modified, because of machine-dependent features. Therefore it
is necessary to deduce the ‘effective’ speed and course from the actual
mechatronic instructions. Within mfd, these are made available under ‘physicalDriver.getMechatronicSpeed’
and ‘phyDriver.getMechatronicCourse’.
<br>The Instructor and the PhysicalDriver are equipped with two machine-type
dependent interfaces that serve as information-objects. The MachineInstruction
contains the data that are calculated in the Instructor and are used as
input for the PhysicalDriver. The MachineSetting contains the mechatronic
instructions that are set on the machine.
