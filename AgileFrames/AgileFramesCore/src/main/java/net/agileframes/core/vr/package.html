<p>Provides all essential interfaces needed to visualize objects.</p>

<p>Every object that is to be displayed in a visual (for example 3D) environment
needs to be a descendant of
the two core classes. By definition they ensure a certain behavior. For example the way in
which Body and Avatar interact with each other. A machine must implement the Body class
and connect to an Avatar class if it is to exist in the 3D frame and have its Position and
Orientation set. Every Avatar may have several geometries and appearances.</p>
