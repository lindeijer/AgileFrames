Contains the core classes of the <i>TRACES</i>-layer of AgileFrames.
<p><b>What is <i>TRACES</i>?</b>
<br><i>TRACES</i> stands for <i>Agile <u>Tra</u>ffic <u>C</u>ontrol and
<u>E</u>ngineering <u>S</u>ystem</i>. This is the conflict-handling layer,
the layer that, amongst other things, must prevent collisions. It deals
with the conflicting use of shared facilities, such as traffic infrastructure.
<i>TRACES</i> is a generic system for agile high-performance traffic control.
It is designed to meet the agility requirements and to handle high traffic
intensities at any scale. It defines an event-oriented control programming
language that is grafted onto Java and is equipped with all facilities
to control concurrent use of shared resources
<p><b>The set-up of <i>TRACES</i></b>
<br>From the functional viewpoint, <i>TRACES</i> offers two programming
languages. One to specify software models of traffic infrastructures and
the related control on the use of communal facilities, and the other to
specify the use of these traffic infrastructures, where the system takes
care of the synchronisation between the abstract and real ‘moves’.
<br>In <i>TRACES</i>, traffic-control completely takes place within a computer
model where, within some margin, synchronisation is preserved between the
progress of the real processes - i.e. the moves of the vehicles - and the
evolution of the state of the computer model. Since physical reality and
its representation as computer model are different worlds, the terminology
in <i>TRACES</i> is kept abstract.
