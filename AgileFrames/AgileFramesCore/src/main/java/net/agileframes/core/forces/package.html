Contains the core classes of the <i>FORCES</i>-layer of AgileFrames.
<p><b>What is <i>FORCES</i>?</b>
<br><i>FORCES</i> stands for <i><u>F</u>unction <u>O</u>riented <u>R</u>esource
<u>C</u>ontrol and <u>E</u>ngineering <u>S</u>ystem</i>. This is the execution
layer, the lowest layer that takes care of the real operations on the machines,
such as the steering of the wheels. <i>FORCES</i> is a generic system to
program Machines from the viewpoint of functionality.
<br>An example is the functional programming of vehicles.
<p><b>The set-up of <i>FORCES</i></b>
<br><i>FORCES</i> operates in the context of a generic system for Traffic
Control, called <i>TRACES</i>.
<br>The elementary machine action, called manoeuvre, realises a trajectory
which is specified as a function of an evolution-variable.
<br>To co-ordinate manoeuvring with other actors, the speed of the evolution
of a manoeuvre can be modified (but not reversed).
<p>Special attention is given to the interface of the physical movement
in the continuous time domain and the interaction with Traffic Control
in the event-time domain.
