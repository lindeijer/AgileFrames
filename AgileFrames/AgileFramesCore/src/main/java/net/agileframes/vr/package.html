<body>

<p>Provides all essential classes needed to visualize objects. </p>

<p>In our simulation model, every entity is split in to two parts. An implementation of
Body which does all the actual calculating. And an implementation of Avatar
that is displayed in the virtuality. Both object should be connected if the Avatar is
to display the actual state of the Body.</p>

<p>Avatars may be created in many different ways. If the Avatar is created by a special
modeling program, like pro-engineer, the (vrml) output can be translated into a usable
format by VrmlAvatarFactory.</p>

<p>The (periodic) update of the Avatar is provided by a behavior object called
RefreshBehavior. This object causes the Avatar to ask the Body every user-defined amount
of time what the new Position and Orientation is.</p>
<p><b>Space 3d</b><br>
The virtuality refered to above is created by the interface Virtuality.
AgileFrames provides a basic implementation of Virtuality in a 3D environment.
The Virtuality3D sets up a frame with a Java 3D canvas and some keytriggers to
permit movement in the 3D screen. Avatars may be added and deleted at runtime.</p>
